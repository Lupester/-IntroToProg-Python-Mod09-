Intro to Programming (Python) Module 10

Introduction                                   
I have learned a great deal of information from this online Python class. Reading the textbook and researching websites articles and performing and completing the lab assignments in PyCharm allowed me to become more of an efficient organizer with my assignments. The course required us to analyze and reflect on solving code scripts issues and creating informative webpages and providing a summary for helping others. It seems like many of the classmates were familiar with Python language.

Summary  
After taking this course for about two months, I finally realized how frustrating learning Python programming can be.   I think most of the frustration was in the amount of reading and viewing the recorded lectures and trying to keep up with the lab assignments.  It was a bit difficult trying to learn PyCharm and follow along with the lecture on resolving issues. I call it “Information Overload.”  What I  discovered was that it takes a lot of patience and repetition to learn the language.  I felt that it was more of an intermediate class for Python, rather than introductory.  For future references,  maybe expand the amount of time to complete the homework assignment and extend the online session time with the instructor to several hours and or extend the class to three months.

Next Steps
 Moving forward, I think it will just need to continue researching for another class that focuses on Python. Continue to use the internet as a source of information and rely on the Python community researching and practice using PyCharm, Git, and Github.
